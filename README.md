# Deep-Learning-Problems

# Basics
- 00 Numpy Tutorial 

- 01 ANN (Only using Numpy)

- 02 CNN (Only using Numpy)

- 03 RNN (Only using Numpy)

- 04 Pytorch - Classification (Resnet model from scratch)

- 05 Pytorch - Regression (basics)

# Transformer-based Models

- 01 Monocular Depth Estimation (using transformer library and pre-trained model)

- 02 Translation using Attention Mechanism (from scratch)

- 03 Stable Duffision using Attention Mechanism (from scratch but pre-trained model weights used for inference)

- 04 Paligemma from scratch (working ...)
