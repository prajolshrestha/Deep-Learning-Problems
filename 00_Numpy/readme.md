# Numpy Refresher


## let's break the IMAGE GENERATION code down into a simple story:

Once upon a time, there was a magical code that could create tables of pictures. 
It did this by using a special machine called a "generator." 
This generator had a button called "next," which when pressed, gave you a bunch of pictures and their labels.

## The generator had some important rules:

1. It needed a map, like a treasure map, that told it where all the pictures were hiding.
2. It had a dictionary that knew the names of all the different things in the pictures, like "airplanes," "birds," and "cats."
3. It could make the pictures bigger or smaller, and it could even make them flip around like a mirror or spin like a top if you wanted.
4. The generator kept track of how many times it had gone through all the pictures. This was called an "epoch."

## Now, the generator had a few jobs to do:

1. It could make a batch of pictures and their labels. A batch is just a group of pictures, like a handful of candies.
2. It could make sure that it didn't run out of pictures by going back to the beginning when it reached the end.
3. It could shuffle the pictures like a deck of cards to make things more fun.
4. It could show you the pictures it made, so you could see what was in them.

And that's the end of the story! The magical code used this generator to make tables full of pictures, and everyone was happy. The end!
